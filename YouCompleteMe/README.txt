Hi guys!  This is the README for YouCompleteMe -- the productivity app!

If there is anything you think we need to know about the code you added, please note it here with a date, so we can keep track of the newest info.
Also, when you pull changes from the remote repo, read this to make sure nothing important has changed.

Since I have started this new job and seen how crazy shared code can become, I have learned the true value of style guidelines!
Here are some style guidelines I think we should follow:

1. Use full and descriptive variable names (duh, Orsega drilled this one in -- right?)
2. Name methods based on what they do, especially when that's a form action.  
   For example, if the method is an on click action for the sign in button, an appropriate name would be something like:
   SignIn_OnClick()
3. Document your code with descriptive comments

Please add any style things that are pet peeves of yours so that we can keep our code clean and pretty!  :)

Thanks for all your hard work!
